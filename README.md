# SpaceTimeOS

SpaceTimeOS presents a new paradigm for distributed, multi-agent computation on agents in a spatial environment.

Agents move around a shared space, and communicate with each other by opening agent-to-agent communication channels, down which they can send lambda functions. The lambda functions move at a finite speed so agents that are close to eachother can communicate more quickly than agents further away.
