// A Spacetime is a vector space that has a partial ordering
// i.e. Spacetime vectors should be:
//      - summable
//      - multiplyable by a scalar
//      - comparable using <= or <
//      - dividable to give a scalar S/V=t such that min t such that S <= Vt
//  [or, we could allow agents to move themselves to any position in their future, and absorb calls at the new position 
//   (perhaps in order of distance) so that an object trajectory consists of an ordered list of positions]
//  [at its most abstract, given an object and a set of call positions, we should have a complete ordering and an intersection point. So, 
//   the object should have a position and some extra information ... i.e. a reference frame ]
//  [A reference frame provides an intersection position given a call position. Intersection points have a complete ordering]
